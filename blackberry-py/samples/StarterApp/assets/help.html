<div style="font-size: large; text-decoration: underline">How to Use This App</div>
<p>This app demonstrates a few basic capabilities that are useful
in many apps, and you're welcome to steal anything from the source
even if it's just ideas.</p>
<p>It shows how to save a settings dictionary, including how to share it
between Python and QML, and how to save it whenever a setting changes.</p>
<p>It shows a simple way to handle built-in help (this page), and both
the help and the settings pages are loaded dynamically only when required,
to keep memory usage low.</p>
<p>The source also shows a simple example of installing a BPS event
handler, in this case to monitor state changes for the virtual keyboard.
Go back to the main screen and make the keyboard appear to see what
that does! (Hint: you can do a two-finger swipe from the bottom
bezel to make toggle the keyboard state.)</p>
<p>Oh, also notice the Leave a Review link below in the action bar...
that's probably a good idea to put in this screen in any app.
Make sure you change set the app id properly though... you can find
that in the URL for your app in BlackBerry World, or as the first
item in the product's entry in the vendor portal.</p>
